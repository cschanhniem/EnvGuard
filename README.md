# EnvGuard

EnvGuard is a lightweight, multi-language suite of utility libraries designed to help developers validate serverless function environment variables against defined schemas at cold start. The libraries fail fast with clear, structured error messages if validation fails, ensuring functions only run with correct and complete configuration.

## Features

- 🚀 Lightweight and optimized for serverless cold starts
- 🛡️ Strong type validation using language-specific schema definitions
- 🔍 Clear, structured error messages for validation failures
- 💻 Multi-language support (starting with Python)
- ⚡ Fast fail-first approach for robust serverless functions

## Available Languages

### Python (`envguard-python`)
🐍 [View Python Package](packages/envguard-python/README.md)

The Python implementation uses Pydantic for robust schema validation and type checking.

## Coming Soon

- JavaScript/TypeScript implementation
- Other language implementations based on community needs
